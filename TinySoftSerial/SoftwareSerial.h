SoftwareSerial.h (formerly NewSoftSerial.h) - 
Single-instance software serial library for ATtiny84A, modified from Arduino SoftwareSerial.
-- Interrupt-driven receive and other improvements by ladyada
   (http://ladyada.net)
-- Tuning, circular buffer, derivation from class Print/Stream,
   multi-instance support, porting to 8MHz processors,
   various optimizations, PROGMEM delay tables, inverse logic and 
   direct port writing by Mikal Hart (http://www.arduiniana.org)
-- Pin change interrupt macros by Paul Stoffregen (http://www.pjrc.com)
-- 20MHz processor support by Garrett Mace (http://www.macetech.com)
-- ATmega1280/2560 support by Brett Hagman (http://www.roguerobotics.com/)
-- Port to ATtiny84A / C by Michael Shimniok (http://www.bot-thoughts.com/)

Notes on the ATtiny84A port. To save space I've:
 - Converted back to C
 - Removed the ability to have mulitple serial ports,
 - Hardcoded the RX pin to PA0 and TX pin to PA1
 - Using & mask versus modulo (%)
 - A few other tweaks to get the code near 1k
More notes:
 - Converted from Arduinoish library stuff (pins etc)
 - Error is too high at 57600 (0.64%) and 115200 (2.12%)
 - Ok at 38400 and lower.
 - Still working out how to prevent missing bits when writing characters
